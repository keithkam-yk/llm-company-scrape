Dear Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer,

We, the undersigned, call for innovation to be at the heart of the next government's plans to combat climate change. 

Supporting ClimateTech firms will maximise our chances of hitting our net zero goals, alongside ensuring the UK is home to the industries, jobs, and economic growth of the low-carbon future. 

This requires a comprehensive and joined-up policy agenda that makes the UK the best place in the world to found a ClimateTech business which can then scale, commercialise and export to other markets. If the next government gets this right, the UK can accelerate decarbonisation across the world.

Whoever wins on 4th July must prioritise ClimateTech innovation - it is an environmental and economic imperative.

We welcome the opportunity to meet with you and your team any time before or after the election.

Sincerely, 
The Undersigned
